## Installation
```
'Go inside of hdba folder'
'npm install .'
'npm start'

## Gameplay:

1. Player throws a dice. Whenever a 6 is thrown, you may place a pawn onto the board. Otherwise you may move 1 pawn so many spaces.
2. Make a move (if you can.) Whenever your pawn would land on another's, you kill them and send them back to their home square.
3. The goal is to get all 4 of your pawns to your street by walking them around the board. Goodluck!
